resume_script

-short script to shorten time it takes to update my resume; 
	
	1. Use MailMerge fields in Cover/Resume to mark fields you want to adjust
		Insert Ribbon > Quick Parts > Field > MergeField
	
	2. In the script each MergeField is assigned to an equivalent variable (in lowercase), which will populate the field.
		'desc' field will take 'Desc.txt' and populate it in very small text to the bottom of your resume in white text
	
	3. UPDATE YOUR FILE REFERENCES. If your resume folder is not inspired by Britney Spears, that's on you.
	
	4. Once all values are updated, run the script.
